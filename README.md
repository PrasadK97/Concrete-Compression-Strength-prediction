# Concrete-Compression-Strength-prediction
Objective: Developed a predictive model to estimate concrete compressive strength using statistical regression techniques.

Methodology:

Applied linear regression to model the relationship between various concrete properties (e.g., cement content, water-to-cement ratio, etc.) and compressive strength.
Employed logistic regression to classify concrete samples into strength categories, providing valuable insights for quality control.
Achievements:

Successfully built regression models with 98.85 accuracy, allowing precise strength prediction.
Enhanced quality control processes by categorizing concrete samples into strength classes, aiding in decision-making during construction.
Impact: The project's outcomes have the potential to significantly improve construction efficiency and reduce costs by optimizing material selection and strength assessment.
